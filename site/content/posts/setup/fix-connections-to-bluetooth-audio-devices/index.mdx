## Fix connections to Bluetooth audio device[](<> "Feedback")

If pressing the **Connect** button in action center doesn't find your device, here are some things to try:

* Check action center to see if your Windows device supports Bluetooth. If it does, there'll be a **Bluetooth** Bluetooth logo button in action center. Make sure it's turned on.
* If you don't see the **Bluetooth** Bluetooth logo button in action center, try updating your device's driver. Here's how:

  1

  Go to **Start** Windows logo Start button, enter **Device Manager**, and select it from the list of results.

  2

  In **Device Manager**, locate your device, press and hold (or right-click) it, select **Update driver**, select **Search automatically for updated driver software**, and then follow the rest of the steps.
* If Bluetooth is turned on and the driver is up to date but your device still doesn't work, try removing the device and re-pairing it. Here's how:

  1

  Go to **Start** Windows logo Start button, enter **Devices**, select **Bluetooth and other devices settings** >select the device > **Remove device** > **Yes.**

  2

  Try pairing again.
* Make sure that the Bluetooth-enabled audio device is on and discoverable. How you do this
